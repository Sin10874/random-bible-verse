## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### 1. FAQ Schema Markup (FAQPage)

Add to each content-rich page:

```typescript
// components/FAQSchema.tsx
interface FAQItem {
  question: string;
  answer: string;
}

interface FAQSchemaProps {
  faqs: FAQItem[];
}

export function FAQSchema({ faqs }: FAQSchemaProps) {
  const schema = {
    '@context': 'https://schema.org',
    '@type': 'FAQPage',
    mainEntity: faqs.map((faq) => ({
      '@type': 'Question',
      name: faq.question,
      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: faq.answer,
      },
    })),
  };

  return (
    <script
      type="application/ld+json"
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(schema) }}
    />
  );
}
```

### 2. Citation-Friendly HTML Structure

Use semantic HTML that AI can parse:

```html
<!-- Clear question-answer pairs -->
<section itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
  <h3 itemprop="name">What is the most popular Bible verse about love?</h3>
  <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
    <p itemprop="text">
      The most popular Bible verse about love is John 3:16: "For God so
      loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son..."
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- Clear data tables -->
<table>
  <caption>Top 10 Love Bible Verses</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Rank</th>
      <th>Verse</th>
      <th>Reference</th>
      <th>Theme</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>"For God so loved the world..."</td>
      <td>John 3:16</td>
      <td>God's Love</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```
